# 🚑 Hospital Dispatch Simulation

This is a C++ simulation system for managing ambulance dispatch requests in a multi-hospital environment. It was developed as a course project for Data Structures at Zewail City.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/`: All source `.cpp` files (logic and simulation)
- `input/`: Placeholder for input data used in the simulation

## ✅ Features
- Dispatch simulation for NP (normal), SP (special), and EP (emergency) patients
- Priority and FCFS queue handling
- Distance matrix between hospitals
- Car utilization and time tracking

## 🛠 How to Compile

```bash
cd src
g++ *.cpp -o dispatch_sim
```

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
./dispatch_sim
```

Ensure `input.txt` is correctly placed in the `input/` directory.
